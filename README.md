## Code Formatting

- following [AirBnB styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- linting is built into react-scripts [CRA config source](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-react-app/index.js)
- use prettier to automatically format code

## Styles

We are using a hybrid approach to styling. The preferred system is CSS modules for its simplicity and statically compiled performance. However MUI forces us to use their style and theming system.

- use MUI css-in-js styling for theme and theme dependent styling
- use CSS modules for components that are independent and reusable. Can support using css variable overrides to customize it.
- share variables using css variables
- using some global styles for reset css and libraries like animate.css

## Typescript
We are primarily using typescript to better handle type errors, and documentation and IDE assistance. We do not have to strictly type part of the codebase. Focus on defining types for the core logic of the application first.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
